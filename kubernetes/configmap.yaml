# Placeholder for future ConfigMap definitions.
# Currently, central_config.json is bundled within the Docker images for both services.
#
# For future flexibility, parts of central_config.json or the entire file could be
# externalized into a ConfigMap. This would allow configuration changes without
# rebuilding Docker images.
#
# Example of how a ConfigMap might be structured:
#
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: ConfigMap
# metadata:
#   name: app-central-config
# data:
#   central_config.json: |
#     {
#       "service_name": "shared_app_config",
#       "database": {
#         "type": "sqlite",
#         "name": "/mnt/data/shared_app_data.db" // Path would need to be accessible via volume mount
#       },
#       "slack": {
#         "bot_token": "OVERRIDDEN_BY_SECRET_OR_ENV_VAR", // Sensitive data better in Secrets
#         "default_channel_id": "C12345678"
#       },
#       "exchanges": [
#         {
#           "name": "binance_live",
#           "api_key": "OVERRIDDEN_BY_SECRET_OR_ENV_VAR",
#           "secret_key": "OVERRIDDEN_BY_SECRET_OR_ENV_VAR"
#         }
#       ],
#       "algorithms": [
#         {
#           "name": "default_algo",
#           "parameters": {
#             "some_param": "some_value_from_configmap"
#           }
#         }
#       ],
#       "other_settings": {
#         "setting_from_configmap": true
#       }
#     }
#
# If this approach is adopted:
# 1. Dockerfiles would be modified to NOT copy central_config.json.
# 2. Applications (in their main.py or config_management/loader.py) would need to be
#    updated to read the configuration from a file path specified by an environment
#    variable, which would point to the mounted ConfigMap volume (e.g., /etc/config/central_config.json).
# 3. Deployment YAMLs would need to define VolumeMounts for the containers and Volumes
#    referencing this ConfigMap.
#
# For sensitive data like API keys or bot tokens, Kubernetes Secrets should be used
# instead of or in conjunction with ConfigMaps, mounted as environment variables or files.

# --- No actual ConfigMap resource defined in this iteration. ---
# This file serves as a note for future enhancements.
